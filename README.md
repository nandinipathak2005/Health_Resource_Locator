Health Resource Locator
A console-based multilingual application designed to enhance accessibility to affordable healthcare services. This tool leverages graph algorithms to help users locate hospitals and clinics offering quality care at minimal costs, with customizable filtering options to meet individual needs.

üåü Features
Multilingual Support: Available in multiple languages to cater to diverse user groups.
Optimized Pathfinding: Uses graph algorithms to find the nearest and most affordable healthcare services.
Customizable Filters: Users can filter results based on multiple criteria such as:
Budget Range: Find healthcare services within a specific cost range.
Proximity: Locate hospitals and clinics closest to the user‚Äôs location.
Available Services: Filter by specific healthcare services (e.g., emergency care, pediatrics, etc.).
Ratings: Sort healthcare providers based on user ratings or overall reputation.
Working Hours: Find services that are open during preferred hours or days.
User-Centric Design: Specifically aimed at helping low-income individuals find affordable and quality healthcare options.
Improves Healthcare Accessibility: Bridges the gap between underserved communities and necessary healthcare services.
üí° Inspiration
Healthcare services are often difficult to access for low-income communities due to distance, cost, and lack of information. This application empowers users to make informed decisions by offering a comprehensive, easy-to-use tool for locating affordable and quality healthcare services based on personal preferences.

üöÄ How It Works
Input:

The user provides their location, preferred language, and any filters they want to apply (budget, proximity, services, ratings, etc.).
Processing:

The application uses graph algorithms (like Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm) to calculate the most efficient and affordable paths to healthcare services.
Filters are applied based on the user‚Äôs preferences to narrow down the results.
Output:

Displays a list of healthcare providers that match the criteria, sorted by distance, cost, or ratings as specified.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Programming Language: [Your language of choice, e.g., Python, Java, C++]
Graph Algorithms: Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm or BFS/DFS for pathfinding and filtering.
Multilingual Implementation: [Specify library or method used, e.g., Google Translate API or hardcoded translations.]
Data Structures: Graphs, Lists, Queues.
üéØ Target Audience
Low-income individuals and families.
People residing in remote areas with limited access to healthcare services.
Those looking for specific healthcare services (e.g., general practice, emergency care, specialists) at affordable rates.

üåç Future Enhancements
Real-time Data Integration: Sync with government databases or health organizations for live updates on healthcare availability.
Mobile App: Expand the tool into a mobile app for easier accessibility on the go.
